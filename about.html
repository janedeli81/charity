                Charitable Foundation "HAPPYOLD"
The fund has been operating since 2013, its founders are Tina Nikolova (Mykhaylovska) and Garik Korogodskyi. We do everything so that people of a respectable age live a full life - learn new things, do sports and hobbies, work at skilled jobs, be healthy and with a light in their eyes. We help them meet their basic needs and encourage them to realize their dreams. The fund also deals with the social adaptation of older people who were forced to move to Kyiv, and delivers humanitarian goods to front-line settlements and de-occupied territories.
                At the heart of our mission is a profound belief in the strength of compassion, the power of unity, and the undeniable rights and dignity of every individual. We are dedicated to supporting disabled individuals in Ukraine, championing a world where everyone, regardless of their physical abilities, has the opportunity to lead fulfilling and self-determined lives.
                Our Philosophy
                Compassion and Empathy: We start from a place of deep empathy and compassion. Understanding the challenges faced by disabled individuals in Ukraine is at the core of what we do. We're not just about offering help; we're about sharing in the experiences of those we support, recognizing their struggles, and working tirelessly to alleviate them.
                Empowerment: True empowerment means providing the tools, resources, and opportunities necessary for individuals to shape their own destinies. We believe in enabling self-determination and independence, helping everyone to achieve their potential and make meaningful contributions to our community.
                Advocacy and Awareness: Change begins with awareness. We are committed to raising the profile of the challenges disabled people face, advocating for policy changes, and fostering an inclusive society that values diversity and equality. Our work aims to shift perceptions, opening hearts and minds to the abilities and rights of every person.
                Community and Collaboration: It takes a village. Building a supportive network of individuals, families, volunteers, and society at large is essential to our mission. Together, we can forge a strong community that uplifts each other, champions shared goals, and provides a foundation of mutual support.
                Innovation and Sustainability: We embrace innovative solutions to the challenges at hand, constantly seeking sustainable ways to improve the quality of life and independence of disabled individuals. Our approach is forward-thinking, embracing new technologies and methodologies that promise a brighter future for all.
                Respect and Dignity: Every action we take is grounded in respect for the individuals we serve. We recognize the intrinsic value of every person, ensuring that our interventions honor their dignity and contributions to society.
                Transparency and Accountability: Integrity is our cornerstone. We pledge to use our resources wisely, efficiently, and effectively, always maintaining transparency in our decisions and actions. Our commitment is to earn your trust through unwavering honesty and responsibility.
